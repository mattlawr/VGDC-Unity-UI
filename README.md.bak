# VGDC-Unity-UI Workshop starter code
Source code repo for the Unity UI workshop for the Video Game Development Club @ UC San Diego
Workshop goes in depth on Unity's UI system focusing on making menus, orienting them, and ensuring correct spacing for arbitrary resolutions.

Forked from https://github.com/Wabadaba/VGDC-Unity-101-Part-2 by Dylan

# How to Open in Unity

1. Download and extract the repository
2. Open the Unity Hub and click "Open"
3. Go inside the extracted folder until you see a folder called "VGDC-UnityUI-proj"
4. Select this folder and click "Open" (It may take a few minutes for this to load)

If Unity prompts to change versions, it should be fine to do so. If you get a bunch of console error messages when loading the project for the first time, they can (probably) be ignored. 

Unity will likely put you in an Untitled scene when opening the project for the first time. To see the sample scene with the finished product of the workshop, navigate (in the Unity Project tab) to Scenes -> SampleScene
