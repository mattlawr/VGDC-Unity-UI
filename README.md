# How to Open in Unity

1. Download and extract the repository
2. Open the Unity Hub and click "Open"
3. Go inside the extracted folder until you see a folder called "VGDC-UnityUI-proj"
4. Select this folder and click "Open" (It may take a few minutes for this to load for the first time)

If Unity prompts to change versions, it should be fine to do so. If you get a bunch of console error messages when loading the project for the first time, they can (probably) be ignored. 
The project contained in this repo was saved with unity 2021.3.16f1

Unity might put you in an Untitled scene when opening the project for the first time. To see the provided scenes, go to Assets > Scenes
